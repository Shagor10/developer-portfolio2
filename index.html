            <h2>I believe in 'never give up' theory</h2>
            <h3>ALLAH can do anything. Do believe ALLAH's judgement.</h3>
            <P>There will be seven groups of people under the shade of the Throne of Allah SWT on the day of judgement.

                On this day that is 50,000 years long, when people will be only meters from the sun and suffering in
                itâ€™s unbearable heat, there are seven groups of people who are so special to Allah SWT that He will take
                them out of the heat and into the shade. This will be the only shade that exists on that day.

                As you look through this video, you will see that you can absolutely be on this list of special people.
                No matter who you are, there is one, maybe more, categories that you can work hard to fall into.

                May Allah SWT save us all form the suffering of that day by placing us in His shade inshaAllah.</P>
